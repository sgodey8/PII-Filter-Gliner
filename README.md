# PII Filter Gliner

This program filters out PII(Personally Identifiable Information) from text and returns it replacing the sensitive words with placeholders.

## Description

The PII Filter Gliner uses the GLiNER model to identify and redact personally identifiable information from text data. It processes text data to detect entities like names, addresses, and other sensitive information, replacing them with a <FILTERED> placeholder. The program also calculates performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the effectiveness of the entity recognition.
